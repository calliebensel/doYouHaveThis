Do You Have Something?
======================
Inventory project for tier 2 week 1 (js/html)
---------------------------------------------
Our client runs an oddities store. The inventory is categorized by size and color. They want a program that allows them to search their inventory for matches in both fields to quicker respond to customer requests easier. Ex: "Do you have something large and purple?".

To do this we'll have an Array that represents our inventory. Within this Array we'll have a bunch of objects with the following:
* name
* size
* color

Basic Features:
---------------
* handshake between js and html (sourcing inventory.js)
* populate the inventory array with item objects
* select size (select element with options within)
* select color (select element with options within)
* get user selection on button click (onClick tag on button element in HTML that runs a function in JS)
* search by both size and color
* display search results on the page

Your challenge:
---------------
Recreate the above project as was made in class. If time allows, try to incorporate the following:
* [] new item input from user input (stored in inventory array. Searchable)
* [] search by name
* [] add some styling

Make sure to push your work to Github when complete!

Good luck!
